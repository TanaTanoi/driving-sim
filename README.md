# driving-sim
A driving simulator for comparing approaches to virtual reality. This is a project under taken by myself (Tana Tanoi) and Prof. Neil Dodgson as part of an ENGR489 Honours project at Victoria University.

## Aim
The aim is compare Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVE) against Headmounted Virtual Reality displays in order to see if peripheral vision makes a difference in the case of a driving simulation. 

Some sections of the codebase are sourced from the Unity asset store and are not created by me, namely, the PostProcessing Stack, the Wispy Skybox, the SteamVR plugin, and the Lens flare. Models and materials are sourced from various places but primarily textures.com.
